# SoPan-Finder

## Introduction
Based on the article “A Technical and Economic Potential of Solar Energy Application with
Feed-in Tariff Policy in Indonesia” (Fathoni, Utama and Kristianto, 2014) Renewable energy
especially solar energy is one of the most potential energy sources as Indonesia lies in the
equator line where the daylight is abundant and available throughout the year. However,
due to the high initial investment costs and many people who do not understand the steps
needed to choose and install the most suitable renewable energy systems based on their
living environment, especially photovoltaic systems, we would like to introduce SoPan (Solar
Panel) Finder as a solution. SoPan Finder will collect weather data (temperature, humidity
and wind speed). LSTM algorithm is implemented on the machine learning model to predict
the energy production for the solar panel. The platform will utilize user’s input to estimate
the energy produced from the solar panel in real-time or in a certain period of time. Based
on the result of energy production analysis, the user will be able to consider the suitability
of installing the solar panels on their house. In this platform, users will also be able to buy
products related to the solar panel recommended by the system.
