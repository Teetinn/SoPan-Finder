# SoPan-Finder

![Alt text]()

## Introduction
SoPan Finder is an innovative solar panel recommendation platform that leverages weather data collection, machine learning algorithms, and real-time energy production prediction to assist individuals and businesses in making informed decisions about adopting solar energy. Our mission is to simplify the process of assessing the suitability of installing solar panels and empower users to embrace renewable energy solutions. 

## Background
Based on the article “A Technical and Economic Potential of Solar Energy Application with Feed-in Tariff Policy in Indonesia” (Fathoni, Utama and Kristianto, 2014) Renewable energy especially solar energy is one of the most potential energy sources as Indonesia lies in the equator line where the daylight is abundant and available throughout the year. However, due to the high initial investment costs and many people who do not understand the steps needed to choose and install the most suitable renewable energy systems based on their living environment, especially photovoltaic systems, we would like to introduce SoPan (Solar Panel) Finder as a solution. SoPan Finder will collect weather data (temperature, humidity and wind speed). LSTM algorithm is implemented on the machine learning model to predict the energy production for the solar panel. The platform will utilize user’s input to estimate the energy produced from the solar panel in real-time or in a certain period of time. Based on the result of energy production analysis, the user will be able to consider the suitability of installing the solar panels on their house. In this platform, users will also be able to buy products related to the solar panel recommended by the system.
