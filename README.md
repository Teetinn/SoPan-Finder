## Cloud Computing
Our responsibilities are build APIs using Express.js for authentication because we found that Express.js is an efficient framework for building authentication API. We also use FastAPI python for running solar panel finder feature. Use App Engine to deploy authentication API and CloudRun to deploy prediction API. And use Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage, and Container Registry to store data and images. And then we also create landing page websites and deployed in Netlify.
